Analyze financial news with FinBERT, blend it with technicals, fundamentals, and unique alpha signals, and visualize cleanly in Streamlit. Supports U.S. and Indian stocks (auto‑resolves NSE `.NS` / BSE `.BO`).

Developed by: Sumanth Nerella

What’s inside
- Sentiment (FinBERT)
  - Overall label and score; per‑headline labels/scores
  - Yahoo Finance headlines with Google News RSS fallback
- Prediction
  - Rule‑based short‑term signal combining sentiment + SMA20 momentum
  - Advanced predictor adds RSI14, MACD, ATR and outputs direction + confidence + rationale
- Charting
  - Interactive candlestick with selectable history: 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 3y, 5y
  - Current Price, Uptrend Trigger (20‑day breakout), Near‑term Target (ATR‑based)
- Fundamentals
  - Key ratios: Price, Market Cap, P/E, P/S, P/B, ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity, Current Ratio, EBIT/Net/FCF Margins
  - Financial statements (annual): Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow
  - Plain‑language glossary for metrics
- Alpha Signals (unique)
  - Opportunity Score (0–100): blends sentiment strength, RSI extreme proximity, MACD cross proximity
  - Divergence: sentiment vs last 5‑day return (captures price–news disconnects)
  - Risk Index: ATR as % of price (volatility awareness)
  - News Heat (48h): recent headline count
- UX
  - Sidebar controls, wide layout, neat styling
  - Data persists across tabs (no re‑clicking Analyze)
  - Explanatory tooltips and glossaries for non‑experts

Quickstart
1) Python 3.10+
2) Install deps:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
4) In the app:
   - Enter a stock (e.g., RELIANCE, TCS, AAPL, TSLA)
   - Choose a period (1mo–5y)
   - Click Analyze once; switch tabs freely

How the predictions work
- Sentiment score = sum(POSITIVE) − sum(NEGATIVE) across headlines using FinBERT tone
- Simple signal: sentiment threshold + price above/below SMA20
- Advanced signal: adds MACD vs signal, SMA20/50 slope, RSI extremes, ATR volatility
- Outputs: Up/Down/Stable + confidence + human‑readable reasons

Uptrend trigger & target
- Trigger: breakout above previous 20‑day high with a small buffer (~0.5%)
- Target: last close + 1×ATR14 (momentum extension heuristic)

Fundamentals data
- Pulled from yfinance’s financials/balance_sheet/cashflow/fast_info
- Ratios computed when possible; missing fields shown as —

Indian stock support
- Enter raw symbol (e.g., RELIANCE, TCS). App tries variants: raw, `.NS`, `.BO` and uses the first with data

Caching & performance
- News, prices, fundamentals cached for ~10 minutes
- First FinBERT run downloads the model (~hundreds of MB)

Deploying
- Streamlit Community Cloud: point to this repo, main file `app.py`
- Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit): include `requirements.txt`
- Render/Railway: start command
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

Troubleshooting
- Missing package: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install the named package)
- Model download slow: first run only; subsequent runs are faster
- No Indian data: try a different variant (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`) or another stock

Tech stack
- Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance
- Transformers (FinBERT tone model), feedparser

What’s unique (tell this in interviews)
- A practical blend of news sentiment (FinBERT) with technical indicators to create explainable signals, not a black box.
- Original “Alpha Signals” dashboard: Opportunity Score, News–Price Divergence, Risk Index (ATR%), and News Heat.
- Auto-resolution for Indian tickers (NSE/BSE) plus robust news fallback via Google RSS.
- Clear glossaries/tooltips written for non‑experts, improving usability beyond typical stock tools.
